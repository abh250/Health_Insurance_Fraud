# Health_Insurance_Fraud
## Scope of the Project

In an Outlook article it was stated as “India is a huge market for insurance but the industry is bleeding losses due to fraud. Insurance fraud leads to around Rs 40,000 crore every year and makes up for 8.5 per cent of the revenue that the industry generates”

Being such a necessity, Health Insurance Firms are still facing losses due to these frauds which cause firms to increase the premiums and lower the profits for the customer which will lead to create tension in the industry. In this particular case study, fraud claims lead to loss of 450 Billion.      
which was (itne)% of the total revenue made by the firm that year.

Now let’s understand what these frauds are:

IRDAI classified insurance frauds into:

a)   Policyholder Fraud and/or Claims Fraud - Fraud against the insurer in the purchase and/or execution of an insurance product, including fraud at the time of making a claim.

b) Intermediary Fraud - Fraud perpetuated by an insurance agent/Corporate Agent/intermediary/Third Party Administrators (TPAs) against the insurer and/or policyholders.

c)   Internal Fraud – Fraud/ mis-appropriation against the insurer by its Director, Manager and/or any other officer or staff member.

And there are several possible ways to detect the frauds to save the firm from losses and that would be the scope of the project to detect the Frauds in a Health Insurance Firm on these three measures and also optimise the process of Health Insurance Fraud Detection by eliminating loopholes in the process. 

## Objective of the Project:
Some of the most common methods implemented by insurers to tackle the menace are:

● Investigation and cross checks of documents to detect the fraud.

● Knowing the potential of fraud: can help minimise the loss

● Use of data analytics to detect fraud

● Running through special investigation of every doubtful claim

● Allocating private investigators

All of the above process could be time taking and might require lots of resources and expenses but here our objective will be using Data Science and Machine Learning to detect Frauds which will apply Statistical Inferences to the Data and will lead us detect pattern for the fraud claims made and also providing an easy user interface for making it accessible to every person and it won’t require technical knowledge and with a simple form entry, our app would be able to tell that the provided case is fraud or no. Also while studying the project we will we rectifying the loopholes and diving deep as much as we can to diminish the losses and no. of fraud cases.
